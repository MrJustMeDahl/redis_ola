## Redis OLA

We were tasked with implementing 2 of the following 6 projects:

1. Redis with Retention Policy in Redis

2. Redis Master-Slave Replication

3. Redis Cluster

4. Redis Security

5. Redis Publish-Subscribe Pattern

6. Redis Bloom Filters

Tasks are specified here: https://github.com/MrJustMeDahl/redis_ola/blob/main/Redis%20Study%20point%20Assignment.pdf

Besides that we are to develop a small application that will make use of one of the redis implementations as well as being able to perform all CRUD operations up against Redis.
